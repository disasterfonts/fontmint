edge following: (need to remove colinear points, need to do a second anticlockwise operation on the inverse for empty cells)

start at 0,0 tile, NW point
log NW point
if tile empty or point already logged
	next tile, start at NW point
else
	open contour (if not already open)
	advance along cardinal (init E) to new point
	if point already logged, close contour
	if next tile is empty, rotate 90, advance along new cardinal to new point
	else
		if -90 diagonal tile is also full, rotate -90, advance along new cardinal to new point
		else advance along existing cardinal to new point



boundary contrast
create grid from all edges
remove edges that straddle two squares of the same colour
merge colinear edges horizontally, store as start/end
merge colinear edges vertically, store as start/end
